General:
To use this plugin, a config file "hue_auth_json.txt" needs to be populated and placed in
the same directory as the mpm client (i.e. "mpm_sample_client")
generated by IoTivity's build system.

Note: A Philips Hue Bridge with a non-proxied internet connection is required along with
Hue bulbs. Bridge should be connected with ethernet and its ip address we can get from
router to which the bridge is connected.


What should this file look like?

    See sample "hue_auth_json.txt.sample" file with contents as shown
    below(without spaces, tabs or quotes):

    "
         [{
        "id":                 "001788fffe168fe7",¬
        "username":           "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"¬
         }]

    "

Where to put this file?
    The placement of the hue_auth_json.txt file should be where
    your mpm client is also:

    <iotivity>/out/<TARGET_OS>/<TARGET_ARCH>/<BUILD>/bridging/src/mpm_client

    Example: <iotivity>/out/linux/x86_64/release/bridging/src/mpm_client
        Depending on your build configuration, the path may
        look mildly different.

What is this username ?

    The username acts like a identity of user for a bridge. Hue API's
    require this username to find out the devices in the bridge. Each 
    Bridge can have many usernames associated with it.

Where can I obtain the username ?

    goto https://developers.meethue.com/documentation/getting-started
    and follow from step3 to obtain Username.

where can I obtain id ?

    id is the Bridge MAC address where u can see at the back panel of the bridge
    it looks similar like this.. 

    00:17:88:XX:XX:XX

   Append "fffe" after 6 digits from starting without any quotes/tabs/spaces
   then it looks somewhat like this :

    00:17:88:ff:fe:xx:xx:xx

    Save ur bridge Mac and username as shown above in same format.


How can I start this plugin?

    Use binary executable 'mpm_sample_client.
