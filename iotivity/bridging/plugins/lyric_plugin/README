General:
To use this plugin, a config file "lyric.cnf" needs to be populated and placed in
the same directory as the mpm client (i.e. "mpm_sample_client")
generated by IoTivity's build system.

Note: A Lyric thermostat with a non-proxied internet connection is required to use
this plugin. All tests/verifications have been with a "Honeywll Lyric Round Thermostat".
This plugin will NOT provision your thermostat for you. You will need to perform
the set-up steps through the Lyric app (this can be found in either the iOS or
Android app store) and your own Lyric user account.

What should this file look like?

    See sample "lyric.cnf" file with contents as shown
    below(without spaces, tabs or quotes). You will
    need to create this. See next questions to know
    how you can obtain your own tokens and ids.
    Example:

    "
        Rtgfeja4637nnvls90nkasvwnklre054
        f02yhajhKDSL64QMWMTRhgsdfgmklbmk
        cdf1519ec9998380fff7abcaf03d404401063cec7a2972dc68d4eef3e6f328e2:
    "

What is contained in this file?

    It consists of three values:
    1. First line of this file represents refresh token value.
    2. Second line represents the API KEY/CLIENT_ID value
    3. Third line represents the CLIENT ID AND SECRET value

Where to put this file?

    The placement of the lyric.cnf file should be where
    your mpm client is also:

    <iotivity>/out/<TARGET_OS>/<TARGET_ARCH>/<BUILD>/bridging/src/mpm_client

    Example: <iotivity>/out/linux/x86_64/release/bridging/src/mpm_client
        Depending on your build configuration, the path may
        look mildly different.

What is this API KEY/CLIENT ID or token?

    The Lyric mapping requires usage of the Lyric
    Developer's API. The usage of this API requires
    that every user/developer has their own refresh Token,
    API KEY/CLIENT ID, CLIENT SECRET. These allow
    liblyricplugin.so to perform actions within your
    Lyric cloud account on your behalf.

Where can I obtain the API KEY/CLIENT ID and SECRET as shown in the above example?

    Please go through the instructions on the below link to
    generate the API KEY/CLIENT ID:

    https://developer.honeywell.com/content/getting-started-guide

Where can I obtain the refresh token as shown in the above example?

    Use the below procedure to generate the refresh token as:
    1. Go to below Link:
       https://api.honeywell.com/oauth2/app/login?apikey=<API KEY>
       &redirect_uri=<redirect uri same as your Lyric app>
    2. Login using your credentials
    3. It will ask for your consent and then it will show the
       accesstoken, refresh token and expiry time in the following
       format as below:
       {"access_token":"f02yhajhKDSL64QMWMTRhgsdfgmklbmk",
        "refresh_token":"Rtgfeja4637nnvls90nkasvwnklre054",
        "expires_in":"599"}
    4. Copy refresh token and put it in lyric.cnf file to be used
       by plugin

How can I start this plugin?

    control this plugin.
