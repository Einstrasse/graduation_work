General:
To use this plugin, a config file "lifx.cnf" needs to be populated and placed in
the same directory as the mpm client (i.e. "mpm_client" or "mpm_client_sarr")
generated by IoTivity's build system.

Note: A LifX light bulb with a non-proxied internet connection is required to use
this plugin. All tests/verifications have been with a "LifX Color 1000 A19" bulb.
This plugin will NOT provision your light bulb for you. You will need to perform
the set-up steps through the LifX app (this can be found in either the iOS or
Android app store) and your own LifX user account.

What should this file look like?

    See sample "lifx.cnf.sample" file with contents as shown
    below(without spaces, tabs or quotes):

    "

        cdf1519ec9998380fff7abcaf03d404401063cec7a2972dc68d4eef3e6f328e2:

    "

Where to put this file?
    The placement of the lifx.cnf file should be where
    your mpm client is also:

    <iotivity>/out/<TARGET_OS>/<TARGET_ARCH>/<BUILD>/bridging/src/mpm_client

    Example: <iotivity>/out/linux/x86_64/release/bridging/src/mpm_client
        Depending on your build configuration, the path may
        look mildly different.

What is this key or token?

    The LifX mapping requires usage of the LifX
    Developer's API. The usage of this API requires
        that every user/developer has their own HTTP API
    Token.This HTTP API Token allows the
    liblifxplugin.so to perform actions within your
    LifX cloud account on your behalf.

Where can I obtain the token as shown in the above example?

    Use the same username and password you used to set
    up your LifX bulb at the following address to
    obtain a token and select "Generate Token":

    https://cloud.lifx.com/settings

    Append a colon ":" to the end of the token and
    place it in your lifx.cnf file. Do not share this
    token with anyone. This token can give someone
    complete access to your LifX account. Be careful.

How can I start this plugin?

    Use the binary executable 'mpm_sample_client' to load and 
    control this plugin.

    More information on these clients can be found at
    <iotivity>/bridging/src/mpm_client/README.
