General:
The "mpm_sample_client" is intended to show how you can
programmatically control the functionality of the
"minipluginmanager" library.

1. "mpm_sample_client" awaits user input before doing
    anything. You will be prompted with CLI controls
    to flex the minipluginmanager library's APIs.

    The only modes of operation are controlled via
    command line arguments upon startup.

    + You may issue the flag "-n" such that all
      resources created by any plugin are created in
      IoTivity's non-secure mode (i.e. no DTLS
      encryption is used for the representation of
      that particular resource).
        (If this flag is not passed in, all
         resources will be created in IoTivity's
         secure mode (all requests/responses will
         use DTLS encryption).

    + Only one plugin will be loaded with the name
      specified

    + Operations performed by the "mpm_sample_client" are
      as follows:
        - Scan - Device Discovery
        - Add - Create iotivity resource
        - Remove - Delete iotivity resource
        - Unload - to unload the plugin and exit mpm_sample_client
