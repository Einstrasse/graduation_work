Build notes

// NOTICE - Transition to SCONS
//-------------------------------------------------

The IoTivity build system is transitioning to SCONS. Although the
makefiles are still available (until v1.0) and some developers are
still using them, they are currently no longer supported. To learn more
about building using SCONS see Readme.scons.txt in the repository root
directory. The build steps used in continuous integration can be found
in auto_build.sh which is also in the the repository root directory.
